My work provides independent technical strategy, assurance, and advisory support for organisations delivering complex digital programmes.

I operate above hands-on delivery, supporting senior leaders with clear assessments, strategic options, and practical recommendations across architecture, delivery, and operations.

**Explicitly excluded:** hands-on development, delivery ownership, on-call duties, staff augmentation.

## Programme Technical Assurance

Independent, time-boxed assurance for complex or high-risk programmes.

This service provides a clear view of technical health across architecture, delivery, and operations — identifying material risks, validating strategic direction, and recommending corrective actions.

**Focus areas**
- Assessment of technical strategy, architecture, and delivery approach
- Identification of delivery, operational, and structural risk
- Review of governance, decision ownership, and cross-team alignment
- Clear, prioritised findings and recommendations for leadership

**Best suited when:**
- Programmes are scaling faster than governance
- Delivery or operational risk is increasing
- Leadership needs an independent technical view 

**Typical duration:** 6–12 weeks (remote)  
**Pricing guidance:** typically **£22k–£35k**, depending on scope and risk profile

## Fractional technical advisor

Ongoing senior technical judgement without hiring.

I work alongside senior stakeholders to provide continuity of oversight across strategy, architecture, delivery health, and operational resilience — acting as a trusted, independent technical advisor.

**Focus areas**
- Ongoing assessment of technical strategy and direction
- Advisory input into key architectural and delivery decisions
- Risk identification and decision support at senior level
- Support for governance, assurance, and leadership reporting

**Best suited when:**
- Programmes require sustained oversight rather than one-off review
- Leadership needs experienced technical input across multiple initiatives
- Independence from delivery teams is essential

## Programme stabilisation & enablement

Time-boxed intervention to restore control and establish sustainable delivery.

This engagement focuses on stabilising fragile programmes, reducing immediate risk, and setting clear direction for teams to operate effectively after the engagement ends.

**Focus areas**
- Rapid assessment of delivery, architecture, and operational issues
- Identification of root causes and systemic risk
- Clear short-term stabilisation actions
- Practical recommendations for governance, ways of working, and technical direction

**Best suited when:**
- Delivery is under stress or confidence has been lost
- Incidents, delays, or quality issues are escalating
- Programmes need both stabilisation and a sustainable path forward
