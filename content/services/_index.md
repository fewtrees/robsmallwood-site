My work is structured around clarity and control: establish the risk profile, align decisions, and enable delivery teams with pragmatic governance.

**Explicitly excluded:** hands-on development, delivery ownership, on-call duties, staff augmentation.

## 1) AWS Programme Assurance

**Best for:** regulated platforms, government programmes, or multi-team AWS environments where failure is costly.

**Includes**
- Programme-level risk assessment (delivery, architecture, operations)
- Architecture governance review and decision flow analysis
- Resilience posture review (availability, performance, incident readiness)
- Prioritised risk register with mitigation options
- Executive-ready recommendations and briefing

**Typical duration:** 6–12 weeks (remote)  
**Pricing guidance:** typically **£22k–£35k** depending on scope and risk profile

## 2) Fractional Technical Advisor (Retainer)

**Best for:** organisations scaling rapidly that need senior technical judgement without hiring.

**Includes**
- Regular architecture and risk reviews
- Incident review participation and remediation guidance
- Decision support for product, delivery, and senior stakeholders
- Coaching senior engineers/tech leads on ownership and trade-offs

**Cadence:** 1–3 days per week (remote)  
**Pricing guidance:** from **£6k/month (1 day/week)** up to **£17k/month (3 days/week)**

## 3) Stabilisation & Enablement (Time-boxed)

**Best for:** programmes where delivery is moving but predictability and robustness are compromised.

**Includes**
- Diagnosis of systemic delivery constraints and technical debt risk
- Pragmatic ways-of-working reset across roles and teams
- Governance that enables delivery rather than constraining it
- Clear ownership boundaries and escalation paths
- Exit plan and handover so the programme can operate without me

**Typical duration:** 6–10 weeks (remote)  
**Pricing guidance:** typically **£15k–£30k** depending on complexity
