My work focuses on **programme-level technical assurance**: understanding risk, strengthening decision-making, and enabling delivery at scale through pragmatic governance.

I am engaged where **failure is expensive** — politically, operationally, or reputationally — and where senior leaders need clear, independent technical judgement rather than additional delivery capacity.

**Explicitly excluded:** hands-on development, delivery ownership, on-call duties, staff augmentation.

## 1) Programme Technical Assurance

**Best for:** Complex multi-team digital environments where resilience and predictability matter.

Engagements are **scoped to the programme’s specific risk profile**. Depending on need, focus may be placed on one or several of the areas below.

**Typical focus areas**
- Programme-level risk assessment across delivery, architecture, and operations  
- Architecture governance review and decision-flow analysis  
- Operational resilience assessment (availability, performance, incident readiness)  
- Targeted risk register with mitigation options and trade-offs  
- Executive-ready briefings to support senior decision-making  

**Typical duration:** 6–12 weeks (remote)  
**Pricing guidance:** typically **£22k–£35k**, depending on scope and risk profile

## 2) Fractional Technical Advisor (Retainer)

**Best for:** organisations that need ongoing senior technical oversight without the cost or commitment of a permanent hire.  
Common in scale-ups, product-led organisations, and complex delivery programmes.  
**Regulated environments are supported**, but typically require additional assurance overhead.

This role flexes based on where oversight, challenge, and clarity are most valuable at any given time.

**Typical areas of support**
- Ongoing architecture, delivery, and risk reviews  
- Decision support for product, delivery, and senior stakeholders  
- Participation in incident reviews with remediation guidance  
- Coaching senior engineers and technical leads on ownership, trade-offs, and escalation  

**Cadence:** 1–3 days per week (remote)  
**Pricing guidance:** from **£6k/month (1 day/week)** up to **£17k/month (3 days/week)**

## 3) Stabilisation & Enablement (Time-boxed)

**Best for:** programmes that are progressing but suffering from fragility, delivery volatility, or unclear ownership.

The scope is intentionally constrained and time-boxed, with emphasis placed on the areas that most affect predictability and resilience.

**Typical focus areas**
- Diagnosis of systemic delivery constraints and technical-debt risk  
- Pragmatic reset of ways-of-working across teams and roles  
- Governance that enables delivery rather than constraining it  
- Clarification of ownership boundaries and escalation paths  
- Exit plan and handover to ensure sustainability  

**Typical duration:** 6–10 weeks (remote)  
**Pricing guidance:** typically **£15k–£30k**, depending on complexity

### How engagements typically start

Most engagements begin with a short scoping conversation to confirm suitability, focus areas, and expected outcomes.  
If the work requires hands-on delivery, line management, or staff augmentation, I will usually recommend alternative options.
