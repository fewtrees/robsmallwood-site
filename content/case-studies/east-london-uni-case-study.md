---

## Context

The University of East London sought to deliver a student-facing mobile application providing a single point of access to services and information.

The solution needed to integrate legacy systems while supporting future evolution.

## The strategic challenge

The university required confidence that the proposed architecture would support current needs without limiting future capability.

Strategic risks included integration complexity, vendor dependency, and long-term maintainability.

## My role

I was engaged as an architect and technical advisor working alongside AWS and university stakeholders.

My role focused on validating technical strategy and architectural direction.

## Strategic contributions

- Assessed strategic options for mobile, backend, and integration architecture
- Validated architectural decisions against long-term sustainability goals
- Identified integration and evolution risks
- Advised stakeholders on trade-offs and future-proofing decisions

## Outcomes

- Clear, validated technical strategy for the student platform
- Reduced risk around legacy integration and future change
- Stronger confidence in architectural direction prior to delivery
