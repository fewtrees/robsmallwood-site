title: "Higher Education — Student mobile platform architecture and integration"
summary: "Architecture definition for a cloud-based student mobile platform, integrating legacy systems and enabling future digital evolution."
---

## Context
A higher education institution sought to deliver a student-facing mobile application that would provide a single, consistent point of access to core student services. The solution needed to integrate with existing legacy HE systems and a CMS platform, while remaining flexible enough to support future functional and technical evolution. AWS was engaged as a strategic platform partner for the initiative.

## Risk
The institution faced the risk of delivering a tightly coupled, short-term solution that would be difficult to evolve or operate at scale.  
**Without a clearly defined and formally agreed architecture, there was material risk of integration fragility, limited extensibility, and increased long-term operational and maintenance cost.**

## Intervention
I worked in an advisory architecture role alongside AWS to develop and formalise the target architecture for the student mobile platform.

My work focused on:
- Defining a scalable, cloud-based architecture using AWS-supported mid- and back-end frameworks.
- Establishing clear integration patterns for legacy HE systems and the existing CMS.
- Ensuring the architecture supported mobile application needs while remaining decoupled from backend evolution.
- Aligning technical design with institutional goals, delivery constraints, and future roadmap considerations.
- Providing clarity and assurance to stakeholders on feasibility, trade-offs, and long-term sustainability.

## Outcome
The institution gained a clear, formally defined architecture that provided a robust foundation for the student mobile application. The approach reduced integration and operational risk, enabled a consistent student experience, and established a flexible platform capable of supporting future digital services and evolution without requiring significant rework.
