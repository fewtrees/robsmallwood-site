summary: "Defined AWS architecture direction and enabled adoption from C-suite to engineering teams."
---

## Context
Major re-platforming programme requiring a coherent AWS architecture aligned to business constraints and long-term evolution.

## Risk
Misalignment between goals, architecture, resourcing, and roadmap would have created rework, delivery friction, and operational fragility.

## Intervention
- Defined AWS architecture strategy and implementation principles  
- Enabled adoption across executives, architects, and delivery teams  
- Established ways-of-working to reduce friction and improve delivery flow  
- Regularly communicated decisions and trade-offs to stakeholders  

## Outcome
A coherent architectural direction and governance model that supported scalable delivery and reduced programme risk.
