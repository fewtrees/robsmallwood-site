## Context

FutureLearn was re-platforming its core product to support long-term growth, scalability, and evolving business needs.

The programme required strong alignment between business strategy, architecture, and delivery across multiple disciplines.

## The strategic challenge

The organisation needed a technical strategy that supported both immediate delivery goals and long-term platform sustainability.

Key risks were building for sustainability and preventing short-term decisions constraining future growth.

## My role

I was engaged as an architect and technical advisor, operating above hands-on delivery.

My role focused on defining technical strategy, governing architectural decisions, and supporting leadership decision-making.

## Strategic contributions

- Defined technical strategy aligned to business, delivery, and roadmap constraints
- Shaped architectural principles across mid- and back-end systems
- Evaluated options and trade-offs with C-suite and senior stakeholders
- Supported adoption of strategy across architects, tech leads, and delivery teams
- Advised on ways of working to reduce friction and improve flow

## Outcomes

- Coherent, future-proof platform strategy
- Stronger alignment between business goals and technical direction
- Improved consistency across teams and disciplines
- Reduced risk of short-term decisions undermining long-term sustainability
