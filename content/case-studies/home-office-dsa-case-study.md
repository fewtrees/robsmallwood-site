## Context

The Home Office DSA programme involved delivering new digital capabilities across multiple services within a regulated government environment.

The programme required assurance that digital service strategy and rollout plans were realistic and aligned across capabilities.

## The strategic challenge

Leadership needed confidence that the digital service strategy would support new business requirements while remaining deliverable, scalable, and compliant.

The risk lay in misalignment between strategic intent and practical execution across teams.

## My role

I was engaged to conduct an independent assurance review of digital service strategy and delivery approach.

My role focused on strategy validation, cross-functional alignment, and risk assessment.

## Strategic contributions

- Assessed the digital service strategy against delivery and operational realities
- Reviewed how capabilities implemented new business requirements
- Identified risks in rollout sequencing and cross-functional coordination
- Advised leadership on feasibility, dependencies, and strategic adjustments

## Outcomes

- Improved leadership confidence in digital service strategy
- Clearer understanding of rollout risks and dependencies
- Better alignment between strategic objectives and delivery plans
