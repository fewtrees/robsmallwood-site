## Context

FirstGroup operates multiple rail businesses with independently evolved digital platforms and delivery approaches.

Leadership required a clear view of how technology strategy could support growth, cost control, and governance across the group.

## The strategic challenge

Technology decisions were fragmented across operating companies, increasing cost, duplication, and governance complexity.

Senior leadership needed an **evidence-based strategic recommendation** rather than incremental local optimisation.

## My role

I was engaged as an independent technical advisor to assess existing solutions and provide strategic recommendations at group level.

My role focused on technical strategy, option appraisal, and risk-informed decision support.

## Strategic contributions

- Assessed existing technical approaches across multiple rail organisations
- Evaluated strategic options against cost, scalability, and governance criteria
- Identified structural and operational risks in the existing landscape
- Produced a clear, evidence-based recommendation for group-wide direction
- Advised leadership on trade-offs and long-term implications

## Outcomes

- Clear strategic direction for group-wide technology decisions
- Improved governance and cost transparency
- Reduced risk of fragmented or incompatible future solutions
- Stronger alignment between technology strategy and business goals
