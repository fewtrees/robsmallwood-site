# Independent technical oversight for complex AWS programmes

I help organisations run complex digital platforms well — aligning delivery, architecture, resilience, and ways of working so systems scale safely and predictably.

I am **remote by default**, vendor-neutral, and focused on decision support rather than hands-on delivery.
