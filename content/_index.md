# Independent technical oversight for complex AWS programmes

I help organisations reduce delivery and operational risk across multi-team AWS platforms through **programme assurance, architecture governance, and operational resilience**.

I am **remote by default**, vendor-neutral, and focused on decision support rather than hands-on delivery.
