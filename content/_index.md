# Independent technical strategy & assurance for complex digital programmes

I help organisations run complex digital platforms well — aligning delivery, architecture, resilience, and ways of working so systems scale safely and predictably.

I am **remote by default**, vendor-neutral, and engaged where clarity, confidence, and control are required.
