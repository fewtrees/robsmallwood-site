title: "About"

I am an independent technical consultant with 25+ years’ experience advising organisations delivering complex digital platforms.

My focus is **programme-level technical assurance**: architecture governance, delivery risk, operational resilience, and stakeholder decision support in multi-team AWS environments.

I work remote-first and vendor-neutral. I do not take hands-on development responsibilities; my value is in independent judgement, governance, and enabling better decisions at senior levels.

**Selected clients:** GDS, Home Office, Department for Transport, FutureLearn, Barclays, Co-operative Bank, Siemens, IBM.

## Supporting Delivery & Technical Experience

Earlier in my career, I held senior technical and delivery leadership roles across government, financial services, transport, retail, and regulated industries. This experience provides the practical grounding that underpins my current advisory and assurance work.

Across these engagements, I have:
- Led teams responsible for stabilising fragile production systems and improving delivery predictability in complex environments.
- Worked extensively within regulated domains, including government identity, banking, and transport, where security, compliance, and operational resilience were critical.
- Delivered and integrated systems operating at national scale, supporting millions of users and mission-critical services.
- Navigated legacy constraints and modernisation efforts, balancing delivery pressure with long-term sustainability.
- Established delivery structures, governance, and technical roadmaps to move teams from reactive execution to controlled, outcome-focused delivery.

This hands-on background informs my ability to provide **pragmatic, credible technical assurance**, grounded in real delivery and operational experience rather than theoretical best practice.
