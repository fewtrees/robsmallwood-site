title: "About"
---

I am an independent technical consultant with 25+ years’ experience advising organisations delivering complex digital platforms.

My focus is **programme-level technical assurance**: architecture governance, delivery risk, operational resilience, and stakeholder decision support in multi-team AWS environments.

I work remote-first and vendor-neutral. I do not take hands-on development responsibilities; my value is in independent judgement, governance, and enabling better decisions at senior levels.

**Selected clients:** GDS, Home Office, Department for Transport, FutureLearn, Barclays, Co-operative Bank, Siemens, IBM.
